# Clickbait detection

## Introduction

Clickbaits are online articles with deliberately designed misleading titles to lure more and more readers to
open the intended web page. Clickbaits are used to tempt visitors to click on a particular link either to
monetize the landing page or to spread false news for sensationalization. The presence of clickbaits on any
news aggregator portal may lead to unpleasant experiences for readers. Automatic detection of clickbait
headlines from news headlines has been a challenging issue for the machine learning community.
